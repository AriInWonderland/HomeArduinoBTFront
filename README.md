# HomeArduino

Well, that really isn't the name project name but I don't know the official project name so I'll stick with this.

# HomeArduino FrontEnd
This is the actual front-end for the project, for now it's just a button and a system to connect to the HC-05 using it's MAC. I plan on expanding it to use sliders and stuff.

## What's the purpose?
My school always does an exposition at the end of the year and this is one of the projects. It's being developed between 3 different courses.

### What's my part?
I am the programmer, I just have to code a way for the domotics to work, I am using Bluetooth and Arduino (Arduino Uno + HC-05).
I am also in charge of the front-end of this, it will be a react-native app, I was told that it wasn't necessary for me to code it but I am a workaholic so I assumed I had to, and tbh I just want to do it.


#### Just a disclaimer:
This project doesn't have a license yet because I don't know what to use, personally I'd like a GPL one but I still have to ask. Yeah I forgot one of the most important things, I know.
